 (* LOGIC:
    now we wanna distribute the seeds, depending on the number of seeds collected,from which house (n).
    1. So we basically need to go around, starting fron house n+1 and keep droppin a seed
    2. When we run out of seeds,we need to check how many seeds we have in that last house visited
    3. We call the Capture function (if seeds are < 4)
